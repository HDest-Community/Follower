### Quickstart
---
- Bind the command menu key in the mod's options menu.
- The same key that opens the menu also closes it.

### Mechanics
---
For the most part the mechanics are fairly simple and straightforward. Documented here are more niche things that are not obvious at all and can only be found either by trial or error or by looking at the source code.

##### Revival
---
- Blues: the cost starts at 2 sips and scales to a full potion depending on how damaged the follower's body is. Fire damages it badly so that's usually the only time you'll need to use a full potion.
- Blood: get a medikit because you'll need it. Don't attempt a blood revival if you're not at max health. The cost starts at 1 wound and scales up to 30 wounds. You inflict 11 wounds on yourself each time you use the option. To revive the follower this way, you must be crouched for the entire duration and looking at them. If red particles appear, you're doing it right.

##### Incapacitation
---
- If your follower is incapped, you can help them get up faster by crouching and looking at them. Just imagine you're helping them get up. Of course injecting them with a stim would also help with that.
- If it's you who got incapped, the follower will rush to your aid (assuming there are no hostiles around) and help you get up fast, so it's a two-way street.

##### Orders
---
- Orders are mostly straightforward except for some details, such as "go there and cover me", which will make the follower stop whatever they're doing and run to their destination, unless they're patching you up. No one gets left behind. Be sure to cover them if you can because they won't engage any enemies on the way.

#### Modding
---
- Followers can have their arsenal changed to have up to 8 weapons. An example of an SMG-only follower can be found inside the repository.
